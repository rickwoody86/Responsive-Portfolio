				<p>Richard has always been interested in computer technology. As a child he was constantly tearing down old computers and salvaging them for parts. In high school he built gaming pcs for his entertainment. He often heavily modified video games to fit his playing style or provide a new experience. He went to Automotive Technology school in 2006. While in school he was a fine dining line cook. He enjoyed it so much he did it for almost a decade. Deciding to use his education he got a job working for Caterpiller making the cooling systems and hydraulic pumps for heavy machinery. He also worked in a factory that produced Catalytic Converters as a machine operator. Still interested in compuer technology he decided to enroll in UNCC Coding Bootcamp. Thats why he is typing all this mess.
